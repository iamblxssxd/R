**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

My first thing every day is to solve a coding problem!

## Optimizations

Refactoring and optimizing my code is something I do consistently, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The most important thing I learned from solving this endless amount of questions is that there's a long way to go. Being unable to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to learn.

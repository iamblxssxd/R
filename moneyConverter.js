Create a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY) . The input is the amount of USD as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'

For Example:

  usdcny(15) // => '101.25 Chinese Yuan'
  usdcny(465) // => '3138.75 Chinese Yuan'
*/

let usdcny = (u) => (u * 6.75).toFixed(2) + " Chinese Yuan";

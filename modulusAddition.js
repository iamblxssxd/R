/*
In this Kata you should fix/create a program that returns the following values:

false/False if either a or b (or both) are not numbers
a % b plus b % a if both arguments are numbers
You may assume the following:

If a and b are both numbers, neither of a or b will be 0.
*/

let myFirstKata = (a, b) =>
  typeof a !== "number" || typeof b !== "number" ? false : (a % b) + (b % a);

/*
Coding in function ```whatNumberIsIt```. function accept 1 parameter:```n```. it's a number.

To judge the number ```n```. If n is one of the above five constants, return one of these string:

```
"Input number is Number.MAX_VALUE"
"Input number is Number.MIN_VALUE"
"Input number is Number.NaN"
"Input number is Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY"
"Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY"
```

Other values should return ```"Input number is xxx"```. xxx means this number.

For example:
```
whatNumberIsIt(1/0) should return "Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY"
whatNumberIsIt(100) should return "Input number is 100"
```
What you need to think about is how to judge it correctly and effectively and don't forget isNaN().
*/

let whatNumberIsIt = (n) => {
  switch (true) {
    case isNaN(n):
      return "Input number is Number.NaN";
      break;
    case !isFinite(n) && n < 0:
      return "Input number is Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY";
      break;
    case !isFinite(n) && n > 0:
      return "Input number is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY";
      break;
    case n === 1.7976931348623157e308:
      return "Input number is Number.MAX_VALUE";
      break;
    case n === 5e-324:
      return "Input number is Number.MIN_VALUE";
    default:
      return "Input number is " + n;
  }

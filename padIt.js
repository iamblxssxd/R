/*
Coding in function ```padIt```, function accept 2  parameters:
1.```str```,  it's a string representing the string to pad, we need pad some ```"*"``` at leftside or rightside of ```str```
2.```n```, it's a number, how many times to pad the string.
Behaviour
You need to write a loop statement within the function that loops n times. Each time through the loop it will add one * to str, alternating on which side it is padded: the first time will add a * to the left side of str, the second time will add a * to the right side, and so on.
Finally, return the padded string.
*/

function padIt(str, n) {
  while (n < 0) {
    break;
  }
  return "*".repeat(Math.ceil(n / 2)) + str + "*".repeat(Math.floor(n / 2));
}
